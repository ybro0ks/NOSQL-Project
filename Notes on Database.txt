I attached some screenshots of my database so while reading the code, you my corrector can truly understand my design and how i worked with my nosql database to 
solve this assignment

User Personal information is seperate from Purchases which is also seperate from the phones in the shop, user Addresses is embedded into the personal information collections
documents. 

When a user wants to order it uses user id to in a sense reference(which is not a nosql thing) the user to that purchase.

Thank you for reading.

Kind regards and hope my assignment does not give you too much headache to correct.
